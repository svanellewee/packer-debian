Packer Debian Repo and K8s CKA Study Lab

- Allows me to learn about packer and creating custom vagrant boxes.
  - Uses debian preseeds generated by hook and by crook. (Borrowed some bits)
- Allows me to create an environment for Kubernetes training
  - caching scripts that stores docker images on the vagrant share to speed up `kubeadm init`
    - on the vms it's `./share/vagrant-scripts/{load,save}-images`
This was originially a centos thing, but for some reason it seems I couldnt make the CNI plugins work properly on Centos. Might be my own lack of training in the RHEL space.

It would seem Debian is less secure by default, but also simpler to use for learning, less gotchas.
